Hey! I'm **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oren-shomrai" target="_blank">@cartman.dos</a> (Oren Damien Shomrai)**. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Israel. ðŸ˜Ž

I created **<a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=334820" target="_blank">BINGIE</a>**, and contributed to a bunch of other open source tools. ðŸš€

I have been building APIs, self-service interfaces, and internal tools for Infrastructure & Cloud, Application Security, and configuration management data systems, with different teams and organizations. ðŸŒŽ

I'm now working on an open-source project that would help creating an ego-less scuba diver community, through blame-less incident reporting, and drive better decisions below sea level. :whale2:
